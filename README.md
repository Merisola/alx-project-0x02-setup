# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository is part of the ALX Front-End track. It covers the initial setup and structure for a Next.js project using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate best practices in organizing and configuring a scalable Next.js application, including:

- Setting up the project without a `/src` directory
- Using custom aliasing for cleaner imports
- Organizing project folders like `components/`, `pages/`, `hooks/`, `context/`, and `utils/`

This serves as a foundation for building a clean and maintainable frontend project.
